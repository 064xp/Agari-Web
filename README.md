# Agari-Web
School project where we had to develop a fictional company and everything it encompassed, image, identity, product, etc. 
This is the website, made with HTML, CSS and [fullpage.js](https://alvarotrigo.com/fullPage/) jQuery plugin.

This was my first shot at hand coding a website so there's a lot of bad practice and stuff to be improved.
